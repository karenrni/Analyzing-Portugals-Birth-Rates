# Project Overview

This study examines how literacy and age at marriage influence family size in post-revolution Portugal using [Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)](https://wfs.dhsprogram.com/index.cfm?ccode=pt) data. The analysis applies Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models to assess whether early marriage and illiteracy are associated with larger families. Given Portugalâ€™s unique historical context following the Carnation Revolution of 1974, this research provides insight into how rapid educational reforms and shifting marriage patterns affected fertility trends.
